# TicTacToe
This is one of my first programs which was mainly created
as practice for file structure and commenting of code

It currently hosts the following features:

1) Regular tic-tac-toe with 2 players

2) Can be played on any size board that the players wish
(Even non-eqaul side lengths)

If you happen to see anything that you think could of been
done better please feel free to tell me.
